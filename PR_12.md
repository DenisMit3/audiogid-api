PR Summary
- **Handover**: Created canonical `README.md` with Architecture Map and Quick Links.
- **Cleanup**: Archived all 12 Planning docs to `docs/archive/` to declutter the workspace.
- **Hygiene**: Updated `.gitignore` to exclude local/temp files consistently.
- **Indexing**: Added `docs/README.md` to guide navigation within the docs folder.
- **Zero Drift**: Confirmed NO code changes to `apps/api`. System behavior remains identical to PR-11.

Scope / Non-Goals
- **In Scope**: Documentation Reorganization, Cleanup, READMEs.
- **Out of Scope**: Code changes.

Key Design Decisions
- **Archive vs Delete**: Archived plans to preserve history/context for future maintainers instead of deleting them.
- **Root README**: Focuses on "What is this?" and "How do I operate it?" for immediate value to new joiners.
